# Make Web App

This is a php script made with CliMate from the php league to help create a new web app on a Debian machine.

Create the working folders
Create all the necessary files for the VHOST depending on the web server used (Apache Nginx supported)
Then edit the local /etc/hosts file 
Enable the site by symlinking

Then another part of it not done yet is to auto deploy a php framwork to start working (Laravel, ...)
